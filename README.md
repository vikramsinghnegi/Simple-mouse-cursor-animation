## Description

This project showcases a custom mouse cursor animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The default browser cursor is replaced with a uniquely styled cursor that follows the user's mouse movements, creating a more engaging and interactive experience.

The animation is designed to be smooth and responsive, ensuring it looks great on various devices and screen sizes. This project is a perfect example of how small touches like a custom cursor can significantly enhance the user experience on a website.

### Key Aspects:

- Custom Design: The cursor is designed with a distinct style to stand out from the default system cursor.
- Interactivity: The cursor smoothly follows the mouse, with animations that react to user input, providing a lively and dynamic interaction.
- Compatibility: The code is written to be compatible with modern browsers, ensuring it works well across different platforms.
- **Performance**: The animation is optimized to perform efficiently, avoiding any lag or stuttering even on less powerful devices.

This project can be a great addition to personal portfolios or creative web projects, where you want to add a touch of uniqueness and interactivity.
